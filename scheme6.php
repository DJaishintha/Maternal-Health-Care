      <p style="font-family: cursive;"class="py-3">When a mother dies, children lose their primary caregiver, communities are denied her paid and unpaid labour,and countries forego her contributions to economic and social development.
A woman's death is more than a personal tragedy--it represents an enormous cost to her nation, her community , and her family. Any social and economic investment that has been made in her life is lost.
More than a decade of research has shown that small and affordable measures can significantly,reduce the health risks that women face when they become pregnant. Most maternal deaths could be prevented if women had access to appropriate health care during pregnancy, childbirth, and immediately afterwards.</p>

        ANMs cater to a population of 3000-5000 and they are responsible for providing primary healthcare services under nutrition, immunization, family planning and maternal and child health programmes. An important part of an ANM’s work is collecting health-related data. They capture around 200 key indicators on different health parameters. Currently, this information is recorded in physical registers and then uploaded online through data-entry, which is a cumbersome process with duplicity of work.
<br>
APPLICATION DESIGN
<br>

This is an intuitively-designed mobile application targeted towards the ANM. The application is pre-loaded on android-based tablets and provided to individual ANMs.
<br>
SALIENT FEATURES

<br>
EFFICIENT DIGITAL DATA-ENTRY TO REDUCE PAPER WORK
<br>

The application has encoded antenatal, postnatal, infancy and childhood forms for hassle-free one-time entry of data that can be directly uploaded online.
<br>
IDENTIFICATION AND REFERRAL OF FIGH-RISK CASES WITH SMS-ALERT SYSTEM
<br>


The intuitive application gives real-time situational alerts on high-risk factors present and referrals to be done along with correct treatment methodology. SMS-alerts are sent to the concerned health functionaries and family to ensure follow-ups to complete the loop of care.
<br>
ACCESS OF TRAINING VIDEOS
<br>

21 refresher video-guides are uploaded in the application. Created in the local language, they provide a step-by-step guidance on conducting a variety of examinations and tests during pregnancy and childhood.
<br>
IMPLIMENTATION
<br>
Blocks – Dhadgaon and Taloda, Nandurbar District
