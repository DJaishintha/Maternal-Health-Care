<p>Pregnant teenagers face many of the same pregnancy related issues as other women. There are additional concerns for those under the age of 15 as they are less likely to be physically developed to sustain a healthy pregnancy or to give birth.[7For girls aged 15–19, risks are associated more with socioeconomic factorsthan with the biological effects of age. Risks of low birth weight, premature labor, anemia, and pre-eclampsia are connected to biological age,being observed in teen births even after controlling for other risk factors (such as accessing prenatal care etc.</p>

<p> However, in these societies, early pregnancy may combine with malnutrition and poor health care to cause medical problems. When used in combination, educational interventions and access to birth control can reduce unintended teenage pregnancies.</p>

<p>In 2015 about 47 females per 1,000 had children well under the age of 20. Rates are higher in Africa and lower in Asia. In the developing world about 2.5 million females under the age of 16 and 16 million females 15 to 19 year old have children each year.Another 3.9 million have abortions. It is more common in rural than urban areas. Worldwide, complications related to pregnancy are the most common cause of death among females 15 to 19 year old.</p>

		<p class="py-3" >
		Teenage pregnancies and teenage motherhood are a cause for concern worldwide. From a historical point of view, teenage pregnancies are nothing new. For much of human history, it was absolutely common that girls married during their late adolescence and experienced first birth during their second decade of life. This kind of reproductive behavior was socially desired and considered as normal.Nowadays, however, the prevention of teenage pregnancies and teenage motherhood is a priority for public health in nearly all developed and increasingly in developing countries. For a long time, teenage pregnancies were associated with severe medical problems; however, most of data supporting this viewpoint have been collected some decades ago and reflect mainly the situation of per se socially disadvantaged teenage mothers. According to more recent studies, teenage pregnancies are not per se risky ones. A clear risk group are extremely young teenage mothers (younger than 15 years) who are confronted with various medical risks, such as preeclampsia, preterm labor, and small for gestational age newborns but also marked social.</p>

		<h3 class="text-center  " style="font-size: 60px">OTHER FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO ADOLESCENT ___PREGNANCY___</h3>
		<div class="container"  style="font-size: 25px;">
		<p>Approximately 90% of births to girls aged 15-19 in developing countries occur within early marriage where there is often an imbalance of power, no access to contraception and pressure on girls to prove their fertility.</p><br>

<p>Factors such as parental income and the extent of a girl’s education also contribute. Girls who have received minimal education are 5 times more likely to become a mother than those with higher levels of education. Pregnant girls often drop out of school, limiting opportunities for future employment and perpetuating the cycle of poverty. In many cases, girls perceive pregnancy to be a better option than continuing their education.</p><br>

<p>In addition, the unique risks faced by girls during emergencies increase the chances of them becoming pregnant. Factors include the desire to compensate for the loss of a child, reduced access to information and contraception and increased sexual violence.</p>

    <h4 class="card-title">SOCIAL IMPACTS</h4>
    <p class="card-text">The adolescent mothers consistently experienced great difficulty in realizing their life plans, when compared with their classmates who did not become pregnant premaritally in their early teens. Marital instability, school disruption, economic problems, and difficulty in family size regulation and child-rearing were some of the complications brought on by their premature, unscheduled childbearing.</p>

    <h4 class="card-title">MENTAL IMPACTS</h4>
    <p class="card-text">About 77 percent of these pregnancies were unplanned. A teenage pregnancy can change the course of a young mom’s life. It puts her in a place where she’s responsible not only for herself, but also for another human being.

Carrying a baby and becoming a mom not only creates physical changes. Women also go through mental changes. Young moms face added stress from:

sleepless nights
arranging child care
making doctor’s appointments
attempting to finish high school</p>

    <h4 class="card-title">PHYSICAL IMPACTS</h4>
    <p class="card-text">Maternal and prenatal health is of particular concern among teens who are pregnant or parenting. The worldwide incidence of premature birth and low birth weight is higher among adolescent mothers.[8][20][32] In a rural hospital in West Bengal, teenage mothers between 15 and 19 years old were more likely to have anemia, preterm delivery, and a baby with a lower birth weight than mothers between 20 and 24 years old.[33]

Research indicates that pregnant teens are less likely to receive prenatal care, often seeking it in the third trimester, if at all.[8].</p>

    <h4 class="card-title">PREACAUTIONS</h4>
    <p class="card-text">Be clear about your own sexual values and attitudes. It will be much easier for you to talk with your child if you have thought through these questions:

How do you feel about school aged teens being sexually active? Becoming parents?
Who needs to set the sexual limits in a relationship? How is this done?
Were you sexually active as a teen? How do you feel about that now? Were you sexually active before you were married? How do the answers to these questions affect what you will say to your children?

    <h4 class="card-title">CARE</h4>
    <p class="card-text">Keep the baby. Many pregnant teens keep their babies. Some choose to marry their partners and raise the baby together. Others rely on family support to raise the baby. Although completing school and getting a good job can be challenging, it can be accomplished with hard work and help. If your teen plans to keep the baby, discuss the challenges and responsibilities involved.
Give the baby up for adoption. Some pregnant teens give their babies up for adoption. If your teen is considering adoption, explore the different types available. Also, discuss the emotional impact on everyone involved.</p>

    <h4 class="card-title">CURE</h4>
    <p class="card-text">Teenage pregnancy often has a negative impact on a teen's future. Teen mothers are less likely to graduate from high school and to attend college, are more likely to live in poverty, and are at risk of domestic violence.

Children of teen parents also are more likely to have health and learning impairment conditions and are more likely to be neglected or abused. Girls born to teen parents are more likely to experience teenage pregnancy themselves.</p>
